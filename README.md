## Introduction

CSSegmentation: An Open Source Continual Semantic Segmentation Toolbox Based on PyTorch.
You can star this repository to keep track of the project if it's helpful for you, thank you for your support.


## Major Features

- **Unified Benchmark**

  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various continual semantic segmentation methods.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the continual semantic segmentation framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized continual semantic segmentation framework by combining different modules.
 
- **Support of Multiple Methods Out of Box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary continual semantic segmentation frameworks, *e.g.*, MIB, PLOP, RCIL, etc.
 
- **High Performance**

  The segmentation performance is better than or comparable to other codebases.
